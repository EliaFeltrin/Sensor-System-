HW_2:   HOMEWORK2_b:                    play a song without delay andwith finger snap
HW_3:   Homework03a:                    send team names trough uart
HW_3:   LCD_interrupt:                  show teams names on lcd with interrupt
HW_4:   Lab 5 Potentiometer:            read data from potentiometer and transmit them through UART
HW_4:   Lab04_Project2cBis:             read data from potentiometer and transmit them through LCD with drawbar
HW_5:   Lab 6 3-Sensors-DMA:            acquisition of three different data channels (Potentiometer, internal temperature sensor and internal Vref) and transmit them through UART ELEONARA
HW_5:   HOMEWORK05_3a:                  acquisition of three different data channels (Potentiometer, internal temperature sensor and internal Vref) and transmit them through UART BRAVIN
HW_5:   Lab 6 Photo-DMA:                LDR value is first read and then converted into a lux value 
HW_6:   Lab07_Project1b_I2CTempCplt:    ead the LM75B temperature sensor values each second through I2C communication and show them in terminal through UART communication.
HW_6:   Lab 7 I2C-IMU:                  read the LIS2DE accelerometer values each second through I2C communication by using a timer interrupt through the elapsed period callback, then send the values to the terminal by means of UART communication with DMA
HW_6:   Lab 7 I2C-IMU-DMA:              tart from the previous readings of the accelerometer and we use the I2C DMA and interrupts to perform a multiple reading of the accelerometer and obtain the right values
